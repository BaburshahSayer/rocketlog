## Self-hosting

One of the original goals of RocketLog is to allow people to self-host it if they didn't feel comfortable using a hosted solution.

While you're free to give this a go, it will currently be a bit of pain due to the use of a licenced subscription billing package (Laravel Spark) which is needed for the hosted version. You could probably remove this package, and remove all traces from the code, but you won't be able to update it easily.

I will try to improve this in the future, especially if there is demand.

In the mean time, you can still view and learn from the source code, and even PR bugfixes and features to the hosted version!
